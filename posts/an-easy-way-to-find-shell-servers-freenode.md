### Any easy way to find free shell servers through freenode
Other than [this website](http://shells.red-pill.eu) and your favorite 
search engine, there is another way to find shell servers.
Connect to freenode(it's an IRC network). then type this command and 
press enter:
```
/msg alis list *shells
```
It will send you a list of irc channels their name ending with "shells", 
not all of them are irc channels of shell servers nor all of them are 
free(as in price).
