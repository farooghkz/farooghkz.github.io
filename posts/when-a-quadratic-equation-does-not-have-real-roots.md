### When a quadratic equation does not have real roots
For any equation as ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 we have b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac 
or DELTA smaller than zero thus having no real roots if:

 1. a, c > |b|
 2. a = b = c
 3. a = b and c > b for any positive b. You can swap a and c.

I have proved these but since it's trivial, I did not write them here.
