         <h3>I hate soccer!</h3>
         <p>
         I'm not talking about any soccer but about this soccer which is ruining everything.
         I hate soccer and I have an ideology behind this behavior:<br>
         Soccer players and other sport players receive too much money and
         fame(players of other sports probably get less) they deserve not. I think most
         people agree with this if not all. You can compare this to salaries of
         doctors rescuing you and your family or the farmer which you would
         die of hunger if they weren't or a writer or a teacher.<br>
         </p>
         <p>
         But why do players get so much? Simply, because people pay attention
         to them. Sport fans from one year or months before a game, buy tickets
         They are greedy to buy clothes of players, their ball, etc. A part of this money goes to
         players' bank accounts. another part goes to other people's account
         participating in this business. So why do they get so much money?
         because <b>you</b> give!<br>
         </p>
         <p>
         Here, many may say we don't spend money on these. We just watch or
         follow. Right, you might not be helping them directly with money but with other
         stuff but you still <b>help them</b>.
         </p>
         <p>
         <i>
         NOTE: Unfortunately, players are not the only group who get a lot
         of wealth. Also actors and actresses receive too much money because we pay
         attention to them. But now, it is world cup and that's why I've
         written about soccer players instead of actors.
