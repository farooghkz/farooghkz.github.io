        <h3>NorthBot</h3>
        <p>
        I developed a NanoBot named "NorthBot" which goes to the north side of the battle field and fires at enemies.<br>
        It fights well with sample bots of robocode.i did not send it to roborumble
        This robot is opensource and under RWPCL.You may download the JAR package(SIZE:2.7K): <a href="../files/farooghkz.NorthBot_1.0.jar">Download</a>
