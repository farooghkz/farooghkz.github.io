        <blockquote>
        I went to hell<br>
        met people there<br>
        Singing and dancing and i asked one of them<br>
        why you are singing and dancing while it's HELL here?<br>
        while it's HELL here...<br>
        They said Mr Spaghetty hell!<br>

        i know it's not much fine, well i didn't want to make a good poem or song or something of that sort, this suddenly came into my brain and i wrote it down! <br>

        For your information you may read wikipedia about this type of hell!
