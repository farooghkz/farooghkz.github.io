         <h3>My favorite games list</h3>
         <i>WIP: this page is under development yet</i>
         <p>
            This is a list of good games which I have in my Ubuntu box and I
            would like to introduce them to other.<br>
            <h4>Terminal/Console games</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <a href="http://seehuhn.de/pages/moon-buggy">moon-buggy</a>:
                In this game you drive a machine on moon's surface and jump
                over craters.
                </li>
                <li>
                <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/doctormike/pacman.html">
                pacman4console
                </a>:
                As its name says, it's a simple pacman game with characters,
                there aren't a lot of levels there(I even couldn't win these
                levels...) but comes with a level editor.
                </li>
                <li>
                nethack: I didn't play its console version, but the graphical
                version was good so I guess its console version would be cool,
                too.
                </li>
                <li>
                bsdgames: It's not a game but a collection of nice games like
                worm, hunt, snake, etc as well as utilities like pig, primes,
                rot13, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                ninvaders: a console version of the famous game Space Invaders.
                </li>
                <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/mevdschee/2048.c">2048.c</a>
                If you have played the famous game 2048, it's just a nice
                console version of it. if not: with smaller tiles you should
                make bigger ones(2 and 2 will be 4, 4 and 4 =8 and so on), you
                will win when you reach the 2048 tile. with a little knowledge
                of C, or even without it, you may make modifications to the
                game and for example use a 5x5 grade instead of the default
                4x4.
                </li>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Graphical games which doesn't require much powerful PCs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>

                    You are a liquid and you should turn other liquids into
                    your color(or eat them), you are win when you are the only
                    liquid in the filed.
                    It is multiplayer and also it supports networking.
                </li>
                <li>
                <a href="http://atanks.sourceforge.net/">Atanks or Atomic
