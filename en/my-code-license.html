         <h3>My Code License</h3>
         <p>
            I was thinking of a simple code license and also short(not as long
            as GNU GPL is!), because most of my codes were not serious and just
            a few kilobytes, and all codes which i wrote till now were smaller
            than GNU GPLv3 in size(you can visit my Github page) so i don't
            like to use a <b>long</b> license, but i also wanted to keep my software
            <b>free</b>(as in freedom), after a little thinking, i wrote this:
            <blockquote>

            </blockquote><br>
            I didn't use it nor i'm sure about it!
